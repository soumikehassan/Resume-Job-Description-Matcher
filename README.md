📄 Resume-Job-Description-Matcher (NLP Project)
A smart Natural Language Processing (NLP) based system that evaluates how well a candidate's resume matches a given job description. This tool helps recruiters and job seekers quickly assess compatibility using semantic similarity and keyword alignment.

🚀 Features
✅ Upload or input resume and job description text

🔍 Extracts relevant keywords, skills, and entities

📊 Calculates a match score using NLP techniques

🧠 Leverages models like TF-IDF, BERT, or spaCy for semantic similarity

📈 Provides a visual breakdown of matching and missing skills

🛠️ Optional: GUI or Streamlit app interface

📚 Technologies Used
Python 🐍

NLP Libraries: spaCy, NLTK, Transformers (BERT or SBERT)

Scikit-learn / Sentence-Transformers

Pandas, NumPy
Streamlit for Web App

🧠 How It Works
Preprocess both resume and job description (cleaning, tokenization)

Extract keywords/skills/entities from both

Use NLP models to compute similarity scores

Return a final compatibility score + analysis report
